After thoroughly going through the requirement, I understood that AWS Elastic Beanstalk is right fit to deploy this solution.
Actually there are few advantages to deploy applications on elastic beanstalk, especially Microsoft .NET applications.

•	Automated security Patching

•	Install custom software if needed.

•	Windows instances can be domain joined.

•	High availability with autoscaling, load balancing and SSL.

•	Simple one step deployment from Visual Studio with AWS Toolkit for VS.
