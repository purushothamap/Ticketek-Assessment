After thoroughly going through the requirement, I understood that AWS Elastic Beanstalk is right fit to deploy the solution.
There are few advantages to deploy applications especially Microsoft .NET applications.
•	Automated security Patching
•	Install custom software if needed.
•	Windows instances can be domain joined.
•	High availability with autoscaling, load balancing and SSL.
•	Simple one step deployment from Visual Studio with AWS Toolkit for VS.
